Leanplum has a number of services. They include:

Deliver messages with "triggers or drip campaigns across the customer lifecycle". Other targeting strategies include "onboarding, engagement, conversion, reactivation, and loyalty" [Leanplum, 05](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/push-notifications-messaging).
* _Mobile Marketing Automation:_ Create "context-rich campaigns that understand and respond to user actions". Target users based on "what users do and who they are", and engage along the full customer journey. Tailor interactions based on behavior, location, timing, and channel. Automate self-activating messages in response to "personalized behaviors" [Leanplum, 06](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-marketing-automation).
* _App Experience Command Center:_ A mobile content management system [Leanplum, 07](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/app-editor)
* _App Personalization:_ Leanplum "provides context and personalization enabled by individual user profiles that get richer over time. Demographic, behavior, location, time, and external data provide the deep insights that power relevance. The key to meaningful engagement is understanding who users are and what they do inside your app." They "capture limitless user events and behaviors to fuel highly contextual messaging campaigns" [Leanplum, 08](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/personalization).

* _Analytics:_ Leanplum's approach is to "capture all events and behaviors associated with a user, without limits or data point costs" in order to "inspire real-time action". Clients can "customize parameters, reports, and metrics". Insights examine "engagement, retention, revenue, uninstalls, and more" [Leanplum, 10](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-app-analytics).
