## Products and Services
Leanplum has a number of services. They include:

* _Messaging:_ Send push notifications, in-app messages, email, and more, using wide broadcasts or personalized content. Deliver messages with "triggers or drip campaigns across the customer lifecycle". Other targeting strategies include "onboarding, engagement, conversion, reactivation, and loyalty" [Leanplum, 05](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/push-notifications-messaging).
* _Mobile Marketing Automation:_ Create "context-rich campaigns that understand and respond to user actions". Target users based on "what users do and who they are", and engage along the full customer journey. Tailor interactions based on behavior, location, timing, and channel. Automate self-activating messages in response to "personalized behaviors" [Leanplum, 06](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-marketing-automation).
* _App Experience Command Center:_ A mobile content management system [Leanplum, 07](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/app-editor).
* _App Personalization:_ Leanplum "provides context and personalization enabled by individual user profiles that get richer over time. Demographic, behavior, location, time, and external data provide the deep insights that power relevance. The key to meaningful engagement is understanding who users are and what they do inside your app." They "capture limitless user events and behaviors to fuel highly contextual messaging campaigns" [Leanplum, 08](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/personalization).
* _A/B Testing:_ Leanplum claims to have "the most extensive mobile A/B testing solution in the industry". Their product "comes equipped with the ability to run A/B and multivariate tests" to maximize return on investment [Leanplum, 09](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-ab-testing-optimization).
* _Analytics:_ Leanplum's approach is to "capture all events and behaviors associated with a user, without limits or data point costs" in order to "inspire real-time action". Clients can "customize parameters, reports, and metrics". Insights examine "engagement, retention, revenue, uninstalls, and more" [Leanplum, 10](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-app-analytics).

Leanplum gathers detailed user profile information and correlates with behavioral data [Leanplum, 11](https://leanplum-wordpress.storage.googleapis.com/Pers_new@1x-min.png).

_International law:_ Leanplum states it is in compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.
