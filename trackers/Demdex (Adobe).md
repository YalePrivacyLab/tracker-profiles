## Products and Services
Adobe's Audience Manager service was build on top of the Demdex data bank product they acquired in 2011 [Analytics Demystified, 01](http://analyticsdemystified.com/adobe-analytics/adobes-new-marketing-cloud-visitor-id-how-does-it-work). Some services include:

* _Segmenting:_ "Build, test, and activate...audiences...based on a set of traits". "Divide millions of records into trait-specific categories" like "moms of grade school kids". Find new prospects with "look-alike modeling"; "pinpoint your most frequent users, as well as how recently they've interacted with your marketing."
* _Cross-device identification:_ Use the "profiling feature" in Audience Manager "to tie one profile to multiple devices" and "discover if users are sharing a device, for instance, within a household". Target customers "after they may logged off your site or app."
* _Reports:_ Generate reports like Optimal Frequency reports, Advertiser Performance Reports to gain insight about user interactions like impressions, clicks, and conversions
* _Predictive analytics:_ Performs predictive analytics
* Organize your own first party data and augment it with second or third party data with the Audience Marketplace feature
* Price your data for sale and partners [Adobe, 19](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html)
* _Geotargeting and location-based targeting:_ Adobe Mobile Marketing offers "support for many location services, including GPS, geofencing, beacons, and more". Geolocation services allow marketers to "measure and respond to user engagement in mobile apps connected to beacons in sports stadiums, retail stores, and other points of interest. Marketers can also easily deliver “local” notifications and promotions based on proximity to a beacon. In addition, companies can tie app interactions to all other app engagement data in Adobe Analytics" [Adobe, 23](https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/mobile/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-adobes-mobile-marketing). Adobe states that "app targeting based on GPS location and proximity to a particular area in a store or event venue", built into Analytics and Target products [MarketWatch, 01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adobe-launches-mobile-services-for-adobe-marketing-cloud-2013-11-07); [Forbes, 01](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/11/07/adobe-takes-its-marketing-cloud-services-mobile); [PCWorld, 01](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2061880/adobe-adds-geolocation-targeting-to-marketing-cloud.html).
* Real-time geo- and location-based targeting: Adobe's in-app messaging feature " allows marketers to promote real-time content (e.g., new video, breaking news) or cross-promote apps, products, or services to people who are actively using their app. Messages, such as full-screen communications, alerts, and local notifications, can be triggered by analytics data, including user behavior, lifecycle metrics, or location (GPS or iBeacons), that is collected with the Mobile Services SDK. In-app messaging can be deployed without the need for app development or a new app update in the app store" [Adobe, 23](https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/mobile/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-adobes-mobile-marketing)
* A/B testing [Forbes, 01](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/11/07/adobe-takes-its-marketing-cloud-services-mobile)  

A variety of other services extend across the Adobe Marketing & Analytics ecosystem. The Demdex SDK may collect information for those services, including Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager [MarketWatch, 01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adobe-launches-mobile-services-for-adobe-marketing-cloud-2013-11-07). See "Details" below.

## Privacy Policy
Adobe business customers "use Adobe Marketing Cloud services to collect and analyze information, such as clicks made by visitors on their websites" [Adobe, 21](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html).

_Data Privacy:_ "App publishers can easily manage opt-in or opt-out functionality to enable compliance with data collection and privacy laws for specific countries including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In addition, Adobe Mobile services customers own their data - not Adobe" [Forbes, 01](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/11/07/adobe-takes-its-marketing-cloud-services-mobile).  

In 2013, Adobe's Ray Pun stated that users must opt-in for geotargeting services, and that companies must write their terms in conditions "in a language that a normal person can understand, not an attorney" [PCWorld, 01](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2061880/adobe-adds-geolocation-targeting-to-marketing-cloud.html).  

_Mobile privacy policy:_ Adobe Marketing Cloud states that a "company may also use Adobe Marketing Cloud technologies within its mobile apps. These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Marketing Cloud account -- for example, how you use the company’s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information."

_Mobile opt-out:_ For opting out of mobile data collection and use in connection with Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe states that "Most mobile devices allow you to the limit use of mobile advertising identifiers for interest-based advertising. For more information, please review the instructions provided by your mobile device manufacturer. The Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices app may also provide you with more options to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising within mobile apps. Please see Your Privacy Choices to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions."

Adobe has an opt-out web page [Adobe, 21](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) and a page for Audience Manager privacy policy [Adobe, 22](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/faq_privacy.html).

Adobe suggests users "review the privacy policy" of the mobile app company "as well as privacy information provided by your mobile device manufacturer" [Adobe, 20](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html). They also recommend "self-regulatory sites" like the Digital Advertising Alliance to opt out of advertising solutions by companies who are members of those groups [Adobe, 21](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html).

## Relationships
_Clients:_ Princess / Conde Nast / Lenovo [Adobe, 17](http://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html)

## Details
### Financial details & history
In 2011, Adobe acquired Demdex for $109 million [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/demdex). Demdex offered a "behavioral data bank" for advertising purposes. The data bank was used for audience segmenting, and could be plugged into ad servers or services, giving websites and advertisers control over the data. DemDex was added to Adobe's "Online Marketing Suite" (powered by Adobe-acquired Omniture) [TechCrunch, 01](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/adobe-buys-behavioral-data-management-platform-demdex).  

### Adobe Audience Manager
Adobe Audience Manager is Adobe's data management platform, built on top of the Demdex product they acquired in 2011 [Analytics Demystified, 01](http://analyticsdemystified.com/adobe-analytics/adobes-new-marketing-cloud-visitor-id-how-does-it-work). Audience Manager:

* Gives a "complete view" of an audience by combining clients' data sources into one place [Adobe, 17](http://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html)
* Segments audiences for "smart targeting" and "personalization" for targeted advertisements [Adobe, 02](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager/audience-segmentation.html)
* Targets "specific segments on any platform" [Adobe, 19](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html)

It aims to provide "a seamless experience and a seamless profile for all the different marketing cloud solutions to use. It's also a gateway for the broader ecosystem" such that clients with their own proprietary platforms or working with other technologies outside of Adobe, "audience manager helps with the syndication and consistency of that audience regardless of the actual technology that is serving and delivering that audience experience. Ultimately Audience Manager allows marketers to take this vast amount of information, transform it into meaningful audience segments, to deliver the most effective message at the right time" [Adobe, 18](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html#m226a251c23c15530b6f70ef20da2003c)

Products it integrates with include Adobe Target and Adobe Media Optimizer, as well as solutions beyond the Marketing Cloud [Adobe, 19](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html#x).
