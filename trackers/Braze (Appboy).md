* Application usage
* Personally identifiable information: Braze "may collect personally identifiable information shared with Developer Applications. We may also collect personally identifiable information from third parties used for authentication, such as when a user logs in to a Developer Application using a Facebook account, and from third party partners such as Facebook, Twitter, and Klout. Personally identifiable information collected may include information like name, email address, location, gender, interests, device, app usage, user ID, and contact information".

_Location Information:_ Braze "may collect device location information if location services are enabled for any Developer Applications on the device. We use location information to provide Developers with information about the use of their Developer Applications".
