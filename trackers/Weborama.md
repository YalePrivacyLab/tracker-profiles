## Details
_Financial details:_ Weborama was founded in 1998 (listed on Alternext since June 2006 as ALWEB) [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation); it had a market capitalization of €28 million as of 2015 [Wikipedia, 01](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama). Weborama recorded revenues of 24.3 million Euros in 2012 [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); revenues "reached €29 million in 2016" [Weborama, 05](https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures).

### Methods
_Data assets:_ Weborama has "400 million profiles in the European database" and "More than 200 socio-demo, behavioural and intenders criteria". This is used for "data solutions" for advertisers; the Audience Manager gives "an exclusive and native access to 400 million profiles in Europe" with a "360° view of behavioural and socio-demographic data".  Audience Insight "allows viewing the audience structure by age, gender and occupation, along with the distribution of behavioural segments and clusters", which "helps publishers to drill down into their audience profile in real time, and thereby to maximise its monetisation" [Weborama, 04](https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering).

Weborama tags placed on a publisher's website allows them to "collect raw and anonymous navigation data".  They conduct "Audience analysis, followed by a relevant and targeted marketing proposal" to be "conducted within three weeks from the date Weborama tags" the website [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)

Weborama "collects anonymous user navigation data via a network of several thousands of partner websites. These websites make it possible for Weborama to store cookies on users’ browsers to allow for their anonymous identification and tracking over the Internet. Navigation data collected by Weborama only includes non-personally identifiable information (NPII) such as URL pages, software equipment, keywords used for searching, geographic location (at state or city level), and advertising interaction history" [Weborama, 07](https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment).

_Location targeting:_ "Generate qualified traffic in store thanks geolocation" [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/2017/09/retail-which-dmps-use-cases)  

_Big Data:_ "Data is at the heart of its expertise, thanks to its strategists, data consultants, computer linguists, statisticians, mathematicians and developers.  Big Data is the driver of development today at Weborama, and will continue to be in the future. Great cares are taken to collect data anonymously, internet user benefits from more relevant advertising." [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation)

_Semantic processing: Cookies, segmenting, & survey:_ "the data is sourced anonymously from 300,000 sites, using cookies, then processed instantly. this audience classification is a critical process within each database. thanks to this methodology Weborama has a database of 110 million profiles of behavioural, socio-demographic, and purchasing intent data in Europe, 70 million of which are from France. Today, Weborama has identified almost 200 clusters (centres of interest) based on the behaviour of internet users, divided into 23 segments (a segment being a “family” of clusters). Weborama’s socio-demographic database is built from a sample group of 300,000 active internet users in France who responded willingly to a questionnaire giving their age, gender and socio-professional category. by cross-referencing  behavioural clusters with Weborama’s socio-demographic sample group, the sample group data are extrapolated from the database as a whole" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).

_Patented technologies based on algorithms and the automatic processing of language:_ 33 million active URLs; 300,000 sites analysed each day; 110 million active profiles per month; 3.5 million qualified internet users per day; 25 words per day per internet user." [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  

_Knowledge: 3rd party & 1st party data:_ The Weborama 3rd party database enriches 1st party data.  3rd party data is "Data from a third party which do not belong to the advertiser or publisher, but are made available to them for deployment in online marketing", whereas 1st party data is "Data belonging to an advertiser or publisher."

_Audience Segmentation & Targeted Advertising:_ With big data collections, Weborama can identify "look-alikes" of internet users with a similar profile to those who "transform" ("subscriptions to products offered in the campaign").  "This allows them to be offered advertising which is personalised to fit their profile".  Audience segmentation in media campaigns was introducted by an advertiser in 2012; the advertiser was looking to increase the level of transformation while reducing loss of media investments, and called upon Weborama to build a mechanism for its commercial catalogue.  Weborama creates a database, including from data collected by advertisers, and builds a targeted advertising model, which includes a model training phase and A/B testing.  

Data mining is conducted as follows: "this database is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time."  Search and surf data is used; Weborama then views transactions over weeks, and observes outcomes from users in the database which includes 60 million qualified profiles over approximatley 300 columns, including ads viewed, reactions (visit, click), behavior on the website visited, and socio-demographic and behavioral profile.    

Training the model is conducted as follows: From the database, build graphic representation and create permanent tree segments. The criteria most relevant to each product or service can be extracted, where the criteria is based on transformation of the internet users exposed to ad campaigns and impressions.

Weborama's database "is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross-referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time."

Weborama runs A/B testing to determine if the model is working, based on confidence intervals.  Variation can occur for many reasons, such as a calendar event or a holiday.

_Segmentation for publishers:_ "Above all, the aim of publishers is to organise their commercial products so that they can offer advertisers and agencies, in addition to the contextual menu, packs of targeted audiences, enriched by 3rd party data. the second challenge is to build specific audience packs using ad hoc target segments based on both socio-demographic and behavioural targeting (taking account of the internet users’ different areas of interest).  "Segmentation of a site’s audience allows visitor profiles
from other areas of interest to be seen. It is highly probable that a current affairs site has, among its audience, people who enjoy other sites (finance, beauty, fashion, cookery, travel...). this will offer the publishers the possibility of assessing their content quality, as well as that of their audience, while expanding their client base. "

_Two methods of data enrichment from publishers:_ The first method "includes the synchronisation and propagation of Weborama’s socio-demographic criteria and behavioural clusters on the publisher’s site audience. this is possible by identifying profiles recognised within the site’s audience, which are already part of the Weborama database. In this particular case, the adserver of the publisher calls the Weborama database for each internet user. If the Weborama database recognises the socio-demographic profile or behaviour of the visitor to the site, the visitor is transferred to the publisher’s adserver. the publisher’s adserver therefore now contains the socio-demographic and behavioural profile of the majority of its internet users."  

The second method "identifies and analyses the website user’s profiles to create ad hoc target users relevant to the advertisers’ areas of activity."  Here Weborama creates _ad hoc_ profiles, and then there is a "transfer of ad hoc target users": "the transfer of ad hoc users defined above is possible using a list of different adserver pixels. this transfer is done by a call of the pixels generated by the publisher’s adserver. the volume of profiles per target required are then available directly in the adserver" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).
