## Products and Services
It is not entirely clear what the Tinder Analytics SDK does. Some news outlets have published details about Tinder analytical practices, often in conjunction with third parties. Minor press about Tinder and "swiping right" offers clues:

"Earlier this year, to combat this collection of overzealous swipers, the company set a limit on the number of right swipes users could make daily. Then it rounded up profiles of the most prolific right-swipers and watched what happened. Would they get upset and leave? Would they stop using for a while and lick their wounds? Or would they realize the error in their ways and be a little more discriminating in suggesting possible hookups?" [Fortune, 01](http://fortune.com/2015/09/29/tinder-interana-analytics/)

## Privacy Policy
The privacy policy for the Tinder Analytics SDK tracker is not public. In September 2017, French journalist Judith Duportail published details about her data request from Tinder which revealed that Tinder had 800 pages of information about her. The profile was created over four years of use, and included information about her Facebook "likes", links to (now-deleted) Instagram photos, her education, the age-rank of men she was interested in, number of Facebook friends, the when and where of every one of her Tinder match conversations, and more [The Guardian, 01](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold).
