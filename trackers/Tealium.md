Tealium's Audience Sizing "allows users to connect all of their customer data, creating a single view of customers and the ability to automate actions across every channel, touchpoint and vendor in your entire digital ecosystem" [Tealium, 04](https://tealium.com/products/audiencestream).

Tealium's "Visitor Stitching" tracks user behavior on and offline, across devices. With this technology, Tealium states, "Previously anonymous visitor behavior will fulfill critical gaps in customer knowledge when cross device activity is merged with known customer profiles". Tealium has a patent on their visitor stitching approach that combines the details from two or more profiles into one. Their "proprietary technology ‘replays’ the data from each of the stitched profiles back in order, so that the profile can be built taking into account the sequence of the customer’s journey".  

Tealium "tracks visitor IDs from a variety of sources including Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Plus and more. When any known ID is matched, visitors, their behaviors, and devices are automatically stitched together. AudienceStream then enables you to take actions using these profile-based attributes and create unique audiences, facilitating compelling omnichannel campaigns that may begin on a mobile device and follow the user to his or her desktop" [Tealium, 06](https://tealium.com/resources/visitor-stitching).
