## Privacy Policy

Teemo states that even without a device identifier, such as Apple's IDFA, they can still identify users: "without the IDFA, and only with the address and the place of work of a person, to find any French would take 5 seconds to a team of 20 people", is it added in the article" (French-English translation; see [L'Expansion, 01](https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/high-tech/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html)).

## Details
_Financial details:_ Teemo (then Databerries) "raised $16m (?15m) in a Series A funding round led by new investor Index Ventures with support from existing investors ISAI and Mosaic Ventures and new individual investors Greg Coleman and Pascal Gauthier. The company will use the funds to launch its product in the US and double its workforce." [Go4Venture, 01](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)  

_Background and history:_ Formerly known as Databerries, Teemo "reinvents offline marketing. Its mobile marketing solution combines user offline behavior understanding and algorithms to drive in-store sales. Its performance-based marketing solution delivers relevant, personalized ads that generate in-store sales it can measure. Co-founded in 2014 by Guillaume Charhon, François Wyss and Benoit Grouchko, Teemo has 50 employees in Paris and New-York." [Teemo, 02](https://teemo.co/about)   

"Founded in 2014, Databerries offers brick and mortar retailers a mobile marketing solution, refferred to as Real Life Targeting, that targets mobile users based on locations they have visited in the past and measures the impact of marketing campaigns on store visits. The solution allows retailers to target users who have visited their stores and those of their competitors. The company’s technology collects geolocation and navigation data from mobile users and targets them with relevant and personalised ads. This allows retailers to generate store visits with a significantly lower cost per physical visit (CPV). Databerries enables retailers to count the cost per visit and therefore measure the impact of a campaign on point-of-sale traffic, offering retailers a solution that works for offline marketing while combining online advertising standards such as accurate targeting, personalisation, performance measurement and return on investment optimisation.

Headquartered in Paris, Databerries employs 40 people and plans to double its workforce by the end of 2017. Since its launch, the solution has generated more than one million in-store visits and supports more than 20 prestigious advertisers on a daily basis. It serves more than 100 brick and mortar retailers including Carrefour, Decathlon, FNAC, Leclerc, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3).

According to the company, offline retailers spend more than $100bn (€93.9bn) on advertising every year, relying largely on outdoor and other offline channels to increase store visits with limited ability to track the performance of their advertising campaigns. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the cross-platform and mobile advertising market is estimated to grow from $25.2bn (€23.7bn) in 2015 to $80.5bn (€75.6bn) by 2020, at a CAGR of 26.1%."
