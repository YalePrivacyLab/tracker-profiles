## Privacy Policy
A Google search for "DoubleClick Privacy Policy" brings the user to the general Google privacy policy web page.

_Cookies:_ Google's privacy policy states that Google uses cookies in web broswers for targeted advertising. They also store a record of the ads they serve in their logs. Log data includes "your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser." They anonymize the log data by "removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months)". Google services, such as AdWords, AdSense, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services, may send cookies to your bro]]wser when you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these services.  

_Other technologies:_ Google may "select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer."  

_Location:_ Google may infer your location "from a variety of sources", including your IP address, search queries, as well as you "precise location from your mobile device" and "websites or apps that you use may send information about your location" to Google.  Google "uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertiser."  

_Mobile tracking:_ When cookies are not available (eg, in mobile devices), Google "may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns."

_Opt-out and user control:_ Users can control cookie tracking through Google Ad Settings, consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, and through the management of cookies in web browser settings. Users can opt out of personalized ads in apps through Android and iOS device settings [Google, 06](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads).
