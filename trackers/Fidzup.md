## Products and Services
Fidzup has two primary services:

1. Drive to store campaign 
2. Retargeting campaign    

Their service is designed to protect retailers for "showcasing" whereby consumers view products in retail stores and look for prices and promotions found elsewhere, especially online.  "Thus," Fidzup states, "those consumers who move to a point of sale but do not buy represent a real 'blind spot' for the brand."

Geofencing technologies make it possible to know precisely the location of the consumer and offer new possibilities to harness data for retailers in stores and leverage the same techniques available to retailers in the online space. This helps retailers:

* Know when the consumer goes to the store, whether they shop or not
* Target their communication with contextualized promotions, or additional services to better inform the consumer during its purchase process" [Marketing-Professionnel.fr, 01](http://www.marketing-professionnel.fr/parole-expert/distribution-retail-geofencing-geolocalisation-indooor-201411.html)  

Fidzup's technology also helps retailers generate in-store traffic through targeting "specific mobile audiences in your catchment area having an affinity with your brand."  

Fidzup's in-store tracking helps retailers retarget customers who physically visited their store, according to their in-store behavior.  According to Fidzup, their "Fidzup Retargeting currently manages to detect 40% of point-of-sale traffic, more than 80% of smartphones... Thanks to point-of-sale technologies, Fidzup Retargeting is able to measure the ROI of all the campaigns sent (store visit, download of the application, etc.) and to report to the company. This marketing tool is therefore much more effective than a classic advertising campaign, because it occurs at the psychological moment when the user considers the purchase and allows to finalize the sale it is done in store or on its m-commerce site." [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip)

Fidzup's technology helps retailers target competitor prospects to "Serve ads to customers and prospects of retail/brand competitors" [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en).

## Details
_Financial details: "Fidzup was founded in 2011 by two entrepreneurs sharing the same idea: to give a lift to traditional business through technological innovation" [Fidzup, 02](https://www.fidzup.com/en/team). They raised $3,7 million with venture capitalists CapHorn Invest and Turenne Capital as well as existing investors CapDecisif Management via the FRCI (Fonds Régional Co-investissement de la Région Ile de France) and Petit Poucet Participation, the press reported in November 2016 [BusinessWire, 01](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161130005981/en/Fidzup-Performance-Marketing-Startup-Retailers-Raises-3.7); [Tech.eu, 01](http://tech.eu/brief/fidzup-raises-investment).

_Awards:_ Fidzup won the 2015 "Kings of Hope Prize" [Viuz, 01](https://viuz.com/2015/03/19/fidzup-trophee-espoir-lndr-2015-les-outils-du-web-pour-re-inventer-le-commerce-physique)

_Fidzup history and ideology:_ Fidzup is "Aware of the opportunities coming from the use of smartphones in your stores, our teams develop microlocation technologies to help you to reach your goals. Continuous innovation and improvement help us to develop more and more relevant and quicker and quicker solutions to install for our customers" [Fidzup, 02](https://www.fidzup.com/en/team). Their ambition is to "Provide physical commerce with the tools that pure players now enjoy". Where on the web professionals are able to identify a highly qualified target to better send them promotions, no solution existed for retailers to recover these prospects.

Since its creation in 2011, Fidzup was working on an indoor presence detection technology. The idea was to offer retailers and shopping centers a light technology to deploy and without constraint of use for consumers. This is how Fidzup Microtargeting was created, a platform for sending interactive and location-based content on the mobile of visitors to points of sale. It is the explosion of Criteo, the French giant of online advertising retargeting, which pushed the Fidzup teams to pivot towards a similar solution, but to the brick & mortar business. Since the startup was already able to understand the behavior of consumers in points of sale.

Specifically, where Criteo is interested in the behavior of Internet users on e-commerce sites to retarget advertising on partner media pages, Fidzup is interested in the consumer shopper journey in physical stores to address contextualized advertising. on its mobile apps." [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip)  

_Devices:_ Mobile (Android, Apple) / Fidbox

_Slogans:_ 

* "Online Offline: Performance mobile marketing for retailers" [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en)
* "An innovative technology for interior presence detection" 
* "A mailing platform for geolocalized interactive content" [Fidzup v2, 01](http://archive.is/kUZGK)  

### Methods
Fidzup "has developed 3 solutions to detect the presence of a consumer in stores: Fidzup Microtargeting, Fidzup Retargeting and Fidzup Analytics. These technologies, easily deployable, are based on the principle of indoor geolocation (operating by wifi, ultrasound or BLE) and broadcast interactive content on smartphone. Thus, Fidzup captures and reactivates the consumer or simple visitor, either directly at the point of sale, or when he leaves the sign." [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip)

Big Data / Predictive analytics / Programmatic / RTB  

_Consumer targeting:_ Geographical/store / Digital navigation (on devices) / Habits / Purchase intention  

"The most accurate in-store tracking technology on the market.  Measure your online campaigns ROI with adapted offline KPIs"  

_Fidbox:_   
  * Works without any mobile app  
  * 3 meters accuracy; 4 years of R&D, 2 patents registered  
  * Autonomous in-store sensor [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en)

Fidbox is "compatible with 99.9% of smartphones". Fidboxes "capture an encrypted identification key, unique to mobile, that Fidzup Retargeting then found on the ad servers. These captured data will be processed to segment the audience of the target brand to address on AdExchanges. This process will thus make it possible to resort to an advertising retargeting by displaying a personalized banner, according to the offline consumption habits of the mobile user, when he / she consults a third-party application (games, news, sports, etc.)." Fidzup's "point-of-sale deployment is lightweight and does not require any particular mobile application."    

_Fidzup Retargeting:_ Fidzup's "Totally innovative process allows the Terrasses du Port not to lose its consumers, increase its customer knowledge and optimize its media buying campaigns by addressing a qualified target. Fidzup Retargeting can also measure the visits of the consumer and know the generated downloads in a logic of measurement of the ROI of the carried out campaigns."  

_Fidzup Microtargeting:_ Fidzup's microtargeting is "based on the principle of indoor geofencing and allows shopping centers & retailers to interact instantly with their customers via their smartphone at their points of sale." It "relies on the use of a sound source to send data to a smartphone that will decode and process the received signal. More concretely, Fidzup broadcasts via point of sale via any audio source (speaker system broadcasting music, sound boxes, televisions, etc.) a signal inaudible to the human ear. This signal has the particularity of having a unique identifier corresponding to a specific location. The detection is done when the smartphone receives the signal and decodes it to know where the consumer is.

Fidzup Microtargeting then automatically triggers the sending of interactive and contextualized content on the mobile of the consumer according to his position. Discount coupons, targeted promotion on a product upon entry into the corresponding department, exceptional opening information, contests triggered as soon as they enter the store ... For example, a brand wishes to launch a promotion on its polos: "1 polo bought, the 2nd to -50% »For this, she will have the choice between sending the promotion on the mobile of the consumer as soon as it enters the store or the entrance of the department concerned by the promotion.

The consumer then receives relevant content, at the right place and at the best time on his smartphone. With Fidzup technology, the sales area is 'squared': either at the entrance of the store itself or within a specific radius, it is possible for each manager to choose the right place, where the visitor will receive interactive content.  

...Unlike other solutions that require the deployment of a heavy hardware device, and therefore expensive to install and maintain, the technology developed by Fidzup can be deployed without any hardware installation on site if the audio system used is remotely controllable. Indeed, some companies have specialized in the implementation of audio systems, the distribution of music in point of sale can be controlled online. These players cover a majority of the retail and retail market. If, however, the customer is not equipped, Fidzup has developed a battery of inexpensive hardware solutions that are easy to install.

- Mobile Compatibility: The software brick developed by Fidzup (the SDK) integrates with applications running on iOS mobile OS (iPhone) and Android. Thus, thanks to Fidzup technology it is possible to reach more than 90% of the global mobile market.

- Use: In the face of the few players capable of detecting presence at the point of sale, Fidzup chose to specialize in consumer care once it is present. Thus, the startup has developed the lightest solution to send promotional content at the best time to maximize efficiency. The end customer has no action to do (except to download the application of the sign or the mall), it is the content that comes to him automatically and at a time when he will be attentive. Since the media is mobile, it is essential to offer end users a limited number of actions to perform for a simple and fluid use."   

This can result in real-time data mining: "Since the operations implemented are mainly digital, La Vache Noire has the possibility to follow in real time the impact of its operation (participation rate, winning prizes, etc.)."  This can bring businesses that did not previously data mine into the data mining fold: "Finally, the marketing department of the center has retained a certain interest from brands that have never participated so much in a digital transaction. Thus, prestigious brands such as Celio, Jules, Yves Rocher or Darjeeling participate each week in the operation 'List of promotions'."  [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip)

"Fidzup has developed a means of communication between a sonic emitter and a mobile phone. Thus, by diffusing a tone, inaubible to the human ear, inside a building we can detect the presence of mobile phones and therefore their owners. How does the detection work? Your visitors must have the mobile application already installed on their smartphone. This contains a software layer (a SDK supplied by Fidzup) capable of detecting the signals and decoding them. What kind of sonic emitter can be used? It is possible to use any audio source to diffuse the signals. In fact, Fidzup has come up with a variety of hardware solutions depending on the user’s requirements.  

... We supply you with one or several bespoke sonic signals to diffuse in your establishment. Depending on the type of building and the type of usage you require, Fidzup offers a choice of several hardware and software solutions to simplify and optimize the diffusion of its sonic technology. Depending on the method of emission chosen, a sonic signal can be used to cover a precise zone of a store, the corridors of a shopping mall or even detect a visitor admiring a work of art in an art exhibition."   

... "Installing the SDK into your mobile application: We supply you with a software layer (SDK) to add to your mobile application. this layer detects and decodes the audio signal. The SDK is supplied with full documentation to help you install it swiftly and easily into your mobile application.The SDK is compatible with both iOS (iPhone) and Android operating systems.  Minimum requirement for the iOS operating system: iOS version 5; Minimum requirement for the Android operating system: Android 2.3.5 (HTC One X not supported)" [Fidzup v2, 02](https://web.archive.org/web/20171015025307/http://v2.fidzup.com/en//notre-solution)

_Fidzup Analytics:_ "Fidzup Analytics is a technology based on wifi that analyzes the traffic in points of sale, especially for shopping centers and supermarkets. Coupled with the Fidzup Retargeting solution, this technology makes it possible to capture on average 40% of the real traffic, whether the consumers / visitors are carriers of the application of the center or not.

To facilitate the handling of its solution, Fidzup gives direct access to the Analytics interface to the shopping center teams. The management can then see the route taken by its visitors from one store to another and analyze the data retrieved by day, week or month. Thus, Fidzup Analytics is able to display the traffic generated in the point of sale, the average duration of a visit, its frequency and to couple all these data to highlight trends or peaks of affluence. For the management of the center, the interest of these crossings of data is of size: to be able to identify the typical course of a customer and thus to define the zones "cold" or "hot" of the shopping mall (that is to say to say the locations more or less visited). Thanks to Fidzup Analytics, retail professionals can have a perfect knowledge of their customers, their habits in the center, but also know if their rental spaces are properly valued according to the passage of visitors. Finally, with the Analytics solution, shopping centers now have the opportunity to measure the audience generated by their communication devices already in place (promotional video screen, POS, display, totem ...). Indeed, depending on the information provided on these media, Fidzup is able to know the impact on the shopping journey of the customer and sales."   [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip)

"Fidzup’s Programmatic & Analytics Platform is made up of DSP, DMP and Tag management solutions, developed in-house for bricks-and-mortar stores. These technologies enable store managers to direct their campaigns while accurately measuring their return on investment."  [BusinessWire, 01](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161130005981/en/Fidzup-Performance-Marketing-Startup-Retailers-Raises-3.7)
