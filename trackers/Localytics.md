## Products and Services
Localytics performs a variety of services for clients:  

* Uniquely identify users and devices via the Localytics tracker: "The Localytics SDK automatically captures and uploads device IDs which the Localytics backend uses to uniquely identify users. Some apps connect to their own backend systems that use different IDs for uniquely identifying users" [Localytics, 04](https://docs.localytics.com/dev/android.html#android)  
* Store and transmit user personal information, such as end user name [Localytics, 05](http://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#identifying-users-ios)  
* Identify users who uninstall an app containing the tracker [Localytics, 06](http://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#uninstall-tracking-ios)
* Track detailed geolocation, even without the use of GPS: "Most apps don't track user geolocation so Localytics uses an IP-to-location lookup service to determine which country they are located in. If your app does track user geolocation, you can use the following code to set latitude and longitude in Localytics much more precisely" [http://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#location-ios](http://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#location-ios)

Localytics leverages the same tracking platform in iOS and Android.
