## Privacy Policy
_Data use and sharing:_ "The AppNexus Platform allows clients to collect and use Platform data. The Platform ingests information provided by third-party sources to allow clients to use such data to target ads. To do this, clients and data providers may use ID synching to enable the use of this information through the Platform."  

"... The Platform enables AppNexus's clients to collect, buy, and sell data and to use Platform Data to buy and sell online advertising. Sometime AppNexus staff give "hands-on" help to clients using the Platform for these purposes, for example by configuring advertising campaigns for clients to best meet their objectives."

"... The AppNexus Platform allows clients to provide and share Platform Data with each other.  Clients also have access to their Platform Data that they collect, acquire, or use on the Platform, and may remove it from the Platform for their own use. AppNexus may provide Platform Data to service providers in order to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance AppNexus' services. AppNexus may provide, or enable others to collect, information for purposes of protecting the safety and security of the online ecosystem, including to detect and prevent malicious activity or fake traffic.  AppNexus may also disclose such information in the event we reasonably suspect malicious activity or fake traffic or when we reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. AppNexus may also share aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally, we may transfer Platform Data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change."

_Precise location data collection:_ "The Platform may ingest Precise Location Information when, for example, an app makes such information available through the Platform."  

_PII:_ "AppNexus does not collect, use, or allow its clients to transfer to or use on the Platform, data that, by itself, directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address, or government identifier. We also prohibit certain categories of sensitive data from being collected, used, or transferred on the Platform."  

_Opt-Out:_ In browsers, AppNexus offers an opt-out web browser cookie to opt out of interest-based advertising. On mobile, AppNexus lists an opt-out option through general device settings in Android and iOS. In Android, the setting is "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads". To stop location collection, AppNexus tells users to either change the preferences on their device or adjust settings in individual apps.  

_Data Retention:_ AppNexus retains data according to "industry standards". "Platform Data is stored using generally accepted security standards. It is usually aggregated or deleted within 30-60 days, but may be retained in the Platform for up to 18 months from the date of collection before aggregation or deletion. Aggregated data is used for reporting and analysis, and may be stored in the Platform for up to 2 additional years. When clients remove their data from the Platform, their storage and retention of data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations."

_Regulation:_ AppNexus supports industry self-regulation, and is "a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct for Web and Mobile" [AppNexus, 04](https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy#choices).
